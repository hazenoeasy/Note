## Typical Unix Kernal Attack
1. IFS Varible
    - Set IFS(Internal Field Separator) variable to include '/' 
    - "/etc/file" same as "etc file"
2.  Find setuid-to-root program 
    - allows increase in privilege
    - normal user to Unix "root"
3.  Open source - see "at" command
    - Has setuid-to-root critical region
    - Region includes:"exec/etc/protect/file"
4. Unix Shell Program - /bin/sh
    - allows copying("cp /bin/sh hackshell)
    - copied program inherits privileges
