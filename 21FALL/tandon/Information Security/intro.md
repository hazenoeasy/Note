# Threats Vulnerabilities Attacks

## Types of Threats - 4
1. Disclosure: unauthorized access to information
    A circumstance or event whereby an entity gains access to data for which the entity is not authorized.

2. Deception: acceptance of false data
    A circumstance or event that may result in an authorized entity receiving false data and believing it to be true.

3. Disruption: interruption or prevention of correct operation
    A circumstance or event that interrupts or prevents the correct operation of system services and functions.

4. Usurpation: unauthorized control of some part of a system
    A circumstance or event that results in the control of system services or functions by an unauthorized entity. 

- examples: using naked photos to track skin cancer

# Security Mechanisms

## Confidentially   Integrity   Availability
1. Confidentiality is prevention of unauthorized disclosure of information.

2. Integrity is prevention of unauthorized modification of information.

3. Availability is ability to withstand unauthorized withholding of information or resources.

# Security Policy
    If we consider a computer system to be a finite state automaton with state transitions then

1. A security policy
    is a statement that partitions the states of a system into a set of authorized or secure states and a set of unauthorized or non-secure states.
2. A secure system
    is a system that starts in an authorized state and cannot enter an unauthorized state.

3. A breach of security
    occurs when a system enters an unauthorized state.

# Goals of Security Mechanisms

1. Prevention
2. Detection
3. Recovery

# Types of Security Mechanisms/Controls

1. Physical Controls
2. Hardware Controls
3. Software Controls
4. Cryptography and cryptographic protocols

# Operational Issues in Security

1. Risk Analysis or Assessment: A risk analysis or assessment analyzes what can go wrong, how likely it is to happen, what the potential consequences are, and how tolerable the identified risk is.

2. Cost-Benefit Analysis: A cost-benefit analysis analyzes the benefits of the implementaiton or a security policy or technology and the associated cost to see if the benefits will outweigh the implementation cost.

3. Laws and Regulations: Depending on the industry a business is in there may be many laws and regulations they must adhere to in the protection of their employee and customer data.

4. Human Issues: Usability: If we try to worry only about security, we can make systems unusable or difficult to use for the users.
