# undefined Behavior in C

INT_MAX+1 is undefined. meaningless

compilers could use und beahavior to generate faster code.

Null deref :  
bar * b = f->b;
if(F = Null)  optimization would delete this statment. cuz this is undefined behavior.

作业需要写gcc 版本

turn on warning -Wall - Wextra -pedantic     -Werror

using static analysis tools to find more warnings

use dynamic analysis tools in combination with a large test suite
