What is a Container and what problems does it solve?
    Layer of Images
    Linux Image Mostly Linux Base Image
    Application Image

Docker Hub 
    docker pull xxx:xxx 
    docker run  xxx:xxx
        if it contains some layers that previously were downloaded, it would not download them again.
    docker ps
        see running containers
Docker Image
    the actual package
        configuration + pkg + start script

Docker VS VM
    Docker doesn't have kernal, it depends on host kernal;
    VM has its own kernal.
Basic Commands
    docker images
    docker ps   list of contains
    docker ps -a all list of contains, included stopped contains
    docker run -d   -- Run container in background and print container ID
    docker run -a   -- attach stdin sdout stderr
    
    docker stop  contain ID
    docker start contain ID
        different containers may run on same port? how? conflict?
        this is containers port, and it is not binded with real port, which means, this container is unreachable
