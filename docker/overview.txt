Docker architecture
    client-server architecture.
    client talks to the Docker Daemon.
    can connect a docker client to a remote docker daemon

    The Docker daemon
        The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and
        manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.
        A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.
    
    Client 
        client sends commands to dockerd, could communicate with more than one daemon.
    
    Docker Registries
        Stores Docker images. Could be Docker Hub or private registry.
    
    Images
        Readonly template with instructions for creating a Docker containers
    
    containers
        A containers is a runnable isntance of an image. Can connect a container to one or more 
        network, attach storage, create a new image bases on its status.

    * think about what happen when run $ docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash

    when I run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.
